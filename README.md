The Look E-commerce Dataset provides a comprehensive view of online retail operations, encompassing various dimensions such as sales transactions, customer information, product attributes, website engagement metrics, logistics and additional metadata. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the dynamics of e-commerce business activities.

Our goal is consumer behavior analysis by customer segmentation: segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior. This enables us to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to different customer segments, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
